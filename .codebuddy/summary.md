# Project Summary

## Overview
This project is a multimedia application that utilizes various libraries for audio processing, graphics rendering, and user interface management. The primary libraries used include FLAC for audio encoding, FreeType for font rendering, Ogg for audio streaming, and SFML for graphics and window management. The project is structured to support CMake for building and configuration.

## Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Languages**: C++
- **Frameworks**: CMake
- **Main Libraries**:
  - **FLAC**: For lossless audio compression.
  - **FreeType**: For font rendering.
  - **Ogg**: For streaming audio data.
  - **SFML**: For graphics, audio, and window management.

## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to create a multimedia application that can handle audio playback and rendering with support for various audio formats. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface and efficient audio processing capabilities.
